# Gameboy_Cart_Dumper
My own PCB layout to create your own Gameboy cartridge dumper. Uses code from InsideGadgets.

The circuit is of Insidegadgets design, I have just made a nice compact PCB to easily make your own. Using the shift registers, you can use a cheap and compact Arduino nano.

My schematic is attached as PDF.

2x 74LS595
2x 16 Pin Chip Sockets (optional)
1x 1K Resistor (optional, can just link across)
1x Arduino Nano
1x Gameboy Cartridge Connector (eBay, Aliexpress)
